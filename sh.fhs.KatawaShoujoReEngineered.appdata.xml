    <summary>A modern version of classic bishoujo-style visual novel</summary>
    <description>
        <p>
            Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children,
            located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside
            down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his
            difficulties, Hisao is able to find friendsâ€”and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main
            paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character.
        </p>

            The story is told through the perspective of the main character, using a first person narrative. The game uses
            a traditional text and sprite-based visual novel model with an ADV text box.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is fanmade modernized version of classic visual novel. It is ported by Fleeting Heartbeat Studios to
            Ren'Py 8, open sourced and de-obfuscated. It contains accessibility features, unavailable at the time of
            initial game release, Russian and French localization out of the box, has useful function to enrich
            gaming experience.
